# I should...

* write proper documentation for my classes
* write tests for all classes and constructs
* write a proper form abstraction that hides plumbing like name source

# I could...

* create a composer package
* clean up Value-class
* let html_tag take a flexible number of HTMLs and concat them itself
* elaborate representation of input to make it read only and take `$_FILES` into
  account
* introduce a possibility to output erros from function calls
* introduce namespacing
    - this seems to be a mess
    - call_user_func does not play well
    - introduces much noise
    - maybe not the right fit for the functionality i intent?
