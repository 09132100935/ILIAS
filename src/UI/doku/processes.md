# Processes

The processes described here affect entries in the Kitchen Sink as well as
their implementation in the ILIAS UI-Framework, as both are in correspondence
to each other. Since the Kitchen Sink is documented in the comments of the
UI-framework, they in fact are different representations of the same entity.

The introduction of the Kitchen Sink as well as the UI-Framework aim at
streamlining the GUI of ILIAS as well as regulating the amount of concepts
used in the GUI. That also means, that a lot of ILIAS componentes and customized
additions to ILIAS (skins...) will be relying on the UI-Framework and Kitchen
Sink entries. The processes described here therefore governs the introduction,
extension and modification of Kitchen Sink entries as well as interfaces to the
UI-Framework.

## Introduction of new UI-Components
