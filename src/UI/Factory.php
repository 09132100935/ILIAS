	/**
	 * description:
	 *   purpose:
	 *       Glyphs are used to map a generally known concept or symbol to a specific
	 *       concept in ILIAS. Glyph are used when space is scarce.
	 *   composition:
	 *       A glyph is a typographical character that represents
	 *       something else. As any other typographical character, they can be
	 *       manipulated by regular CSS. If hovered they change to the link-hover-
	 *       color to indicate possible interactions.
	 *   effect:
	 *       Glyphs act as trigger for some action such as opening a certain
	 *       Overlay type or as shortcut.
	 *   rival:
	 *       icon:
	 *           Icons are not interactive as standalone (they can be in an
	 *           interactive container however). They only serve as additional
	 *           hint of the functionality described by some title. Glyphs are
	 *           visually distinguished from object icons.
	 *
	 * background: |-
	 *     "In typography, a glyph is an elemental symbol within an agreed set of
	 *     symbols, intended to represent a readable character for the purposes
	 *     of writing and thereby expressing thoughts, ideas and concepts."
	 *     (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph)
	 *
	 *     Lidwell states that such symbols are used "to improve the recognition
	 *     and recall of signs and controls".

	 *     Publishers, 2003, ch. Iconic Representation, pp. 110 â€“ 111)
	 *
	 * rules:
	 *   usage:
	 *       1: Glyphs MUST NOT be used in content titles.
	 *       2: Glyphs MUST be used for cross-sectional functionality as mail for
	 *          example and NOT for representing objects.
	 *       3: Glyphs SHOULD be used for very simple tasks that are repeated at
	 *          many places throughout the system.
	 *       4: Services such as mail MAY be represented by a glyph AND an icon.
	 *   style:
	 *       5: All Glyphs MUST be taken from the Bootstrap Glyphicon Halflings
	 *          set. Exceptions MUST be approved by the JF.
	 *   accessability:
	 *       6: The functionality triggered by the Glyph must be indicated to
	 *          screen readers with by the attribute aria-label. If the Glyph
	 *          accompanies some text describing the functionality of the triggered,
	 *          this MUST be indicated by the aria-labelledby attribute.
